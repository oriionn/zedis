//! Dragonfly and Garnet: smoke lanes, not matrix lanes. Each speaks Redis's
//! protocol and is not Redis: a dozen of the `standalone_*` tests do not hold
//! on Dragonfly and half of them do not on Garnet (no streams, no `DUMP`, ACL
//! selectors, `CLIENT PAUSE`, `OBJECT`, `PUBSUB CHANNELS`…), and holding every
//! new test to a third and a fourth server is a cost their share of users does
//! not pay for. What the README does promise is that they connect and the
//! basics work — which is what broke unnoticed (Dragonfly's two-element `ROLE`
//! failed the whole connect) for want of one test that dials it. These are
//! those tests: `IT_SCENARIOS=dragonfly scripts/it/up.sh` (or `garnet`), then
//! the filter of the same name. Everywhere else the variable is unset and they
//! skip.
